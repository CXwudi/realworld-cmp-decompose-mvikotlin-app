This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/)** and **[http4k](https://www.http4k.org/)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the community styleguides & best practices of **Compose Multiplatform** and **http4k**.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
