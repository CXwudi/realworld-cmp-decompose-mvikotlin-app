# Guidance

## Documentation-First Approach:

**CRITICAL: Whenever starting a task, always check for relevant documentation in the `common-doc/` folder first. This directory contains important guidance that should inform your approach.**

### Before Starting:

1. Use the LS tool to explore ./common-doc/ directory structure
2. Read any relevant documentation files that might relate to your task
3. Use Grep/Glob tools to search for specific guidance if needed
   - Quick tip: Search for lines starting with `#` to find markdown headers and quickly identify relevant sections
4. Only proceed with the task after consulting the documentation
